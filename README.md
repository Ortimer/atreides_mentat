# Atreides Mentat - Dune

A helper app for the Dune (2019) board game.
Keep track of your opponents spice stash, which treachery cards they have, and whether they've used the once-per-game Karama ability.

### Implementation
- Implemented using the create-react-app tool - source code in Typescript, and using Redux JS & Redux toolkit for the state management.
- Uses the bulma framework for the CSS.
- It's a progressive web app, so you should be able to install it to your mobile phone's homescreen - or use it in any browser.
